    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list in Python is how they store and access data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **List:** A list is an ordered collection of values, and each value is accessed by its index (position) in the list. Lists are indexed by integers starting from 0, and you access elements by their position in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary:** A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Instead of using indices, you access values in a dictionary by their associated keys. Keys are unique within a dictionary and allow you to retrieve values efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lists use integer indices to access ordered values, while dictionaries use unique keys to access unordered key-value pairs."

    "If we try to access `spam['foo']` and `spam` is `{ 'bar': 100 }`, we will get a `KeyError` because there is no key `'foo'` in the dictionary `spam`. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "To \"pretty print\" dictionary values in Python, you can use the pprint module's `pprint()` function (pretty print).\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "pprint.pprint(my_dict)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pprint.pprint()` function formats the dictionary `my_dict` in a more readable and organized manner compared to the regular `print()` function. It displays nested structures (such as dictionaries within dictionaries) with indentation, making it easier to visualize the structure and contents of complex data types like dictionaries."
