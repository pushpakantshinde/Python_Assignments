    "### Q4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression in programming is a combination of values (variables, literals, constants), operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. It represents something, like a computation, and when evaluated, it produces a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions can contain elements like:\n",
    "1. Literals: Fixed values like numbers, strings, or boolean values (e.g., 5, 'hello', True).\n",
    "2. Variables: Representations of values stored in memory (e.g., x, my_variable).\n",
    "3. Operators: Symbols that perform operations on operands (e.g., +, -, *, /, ==, !=, and, or).\n",
    "4. Function Calls: Invoking functions that return values (e.g., len('hello'), math.sqrt(25)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions can be simple, like 5 + 3, or complex, involving multiple operations and functions, like ((10 * 2) / (5 + 5)) or (len('hello') > 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions, when evaluated, compute or yield a value. They are used in assignments, comparisons, function arguments, and other contexts where a value is expected. For instance:\n",
    "1. Assignments: x = 5 + 3 (the expression 5 + 3 is evaluated to 8 and assigned to x).\n",
    "2. Conditions: if len('hello') > 3: (the expression len('hello') > 3 is evaluated for truth).\n",
    "3. Function Calls: result = math.sqrt(25) (the expression math.sqrt(25) is evaluated and the result is stored in result).\n",
    "\n",
    "All expressions, regardless of complexity, essentially reduce to a single value when evaluated. They're the building blocks of programming logic, enabling computations and decision-making within code."

    "An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value.\n",

    "*** Answer:\n",

    "In Python, variable names have specific rules and conventions. The key rules for naming variables are:\n",
